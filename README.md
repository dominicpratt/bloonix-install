# Bloonix-Install.sh

Bloonix-Install.sh is a simple bash script to install the free and open-source monitoring-software [Bloonix](https://bloonix.org/) on Debian-based systems.

This script is in heavy development and I'd be happy about pull requests and/or bug reports.

Please use this script with caution and **don't** run it on configured systems, only on fresh installs!

Have fun!

## Usage

Simply clone this repository or download the zip-folder to your server, set the executable bit
```chmod +x bloonix-install.sh
```
and run it
```bloonix-install.sh
```

That's it. Bloonix should be up and running on your routed domain. Initial login is admin/admin.
